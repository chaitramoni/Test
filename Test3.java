Q6.	ArrayList and LinkedList:-

	In arraylist read operation is easy.
	In linkedlist read operation is slower.
	
	Array list internally use array.
	Linked list internaly use node.
	
	Array list write operation is faster.
	Linked list write operation is slower
	
	ArrayList contain listiterator()
	Linkedlist does not contain listiterator()
	
Q1. class Array{

public void toFindLargestAndsmallest(int c[]){

int largest = c[0];
int smallest = c[0];

for(int i=o;i<=length;i++){

if(c[i]>largest)
largest = c[i]{
}
else if(c[i]<smallest){

smallest = c[i]
}
}
System.out.printlv("the largest number is " + largest);
System.out.printlv("the smallest number is " + smallest);
}
}



public static void main(String[] args){

int c[45,333,76,29,900,23,474,654,29,454];
oFindLargestAndsmallest[c];

} 
}


Q3. Generalized	 classes are subclases which inherit the properties from parent classes
	Specialized classes are super classes can acquire properties implicitly

Q7.ListIterator-it is  used to access the collection values forward and backward direction
	it is avaliable in list

		Iterator()-it is  used to access the collection values  only in forward direction
		it is avaliable in collection classes
		
		
Q10.static polymorphism means compile time polymorphism achieved by method overloading 
	method overloading means two or more method declared more than once with same name but difference in parameter list
	
	
	dynamic polymorphism means run time polymorphism achieved by method overriding
	method overriding means two classes having same method signature.but difference in the implementation
	
	Q11. hema can achieve sequrity by using encapsulation
		Encapsulation means grouping the data into a single unit
		advantage is data is secure
		
	Q5.sorting that is used is Comparable<> and comparator
